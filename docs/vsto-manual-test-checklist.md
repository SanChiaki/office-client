# OfficeAgent VSTO Manual Test Checklist

## Installer

- Run `installer/OfficeAgent.Setup/build.ps1` and confirm both `artifacts/installer/OfficeAgent.Setup-x86.msi` and `artifacts/installer/OfficeAgent.Setup-x64.msi` are created.
- Choose the MSI that matches the target Excel bitness. Do not install the x86 package for x64 Excel or the x64 package for x86 Excel.
- Install the MSI under a standard user profile.
- Confirm files are deployed under `%LocalAppData%\\OfficeAgent\\ExcelAddIn`.
- Confirm Excel add-in registry entries exist under `HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Office\\Excel\\Addins\\OfficeAgent.ExcelAddIn`.
- On a machine missing the VSTO runtime, confirm the installer blocks with a clear prerequisite message.
- On a machine missing the WebView2 runtime, confirm the installer blocks with a clear prerequisite message.
- Confirm the current MVP deployment flow expects WebView2 runtime preinstallation; the MSI does not bootstrap the runtime yet.
- Note the current MVP manifests are signed with the development publisher `OfficeAgent Dev Certificate`; for distribution outside the build machine, replace it with a trusted code-signing certificate or import the publisher certificate through your enterprise deployment flow.

## Excel Startup

- Start Excel 2019 x86 on Windows with the x86 MSI and confirm `OfficeAgent` loads without manual sideload.
- Start Excel 2019 x64 on Windows with the x64 MSI and confirm `OfficeAgent` loads without manual sideload.
- Close and reopen Excel and confirm the add-in still loads automatically.

## Task Pane

- Use the Ribbon button to open and close the task pane repeatedly.
- Confirm the task pane does not duplicate after repeated toggles.
- Confirm the WebView2 missing-runtime fallback message appears if WebView2 is not installed.

## Session And Settings

- Open Settings and save `API Key`, `Base URL`, `Business Base URL`, `Model`, `SSO URL`, and `登录成功路径`.
- Confirm `Base URL` stays reserved for the LLM endpoint and `Business Base URL` points to the business API or mock server.
- Restart Excel and confirm settings reload correctly.
- Create or switch sessions and confirm existing thread history is preserved per session.

## Selection Context

- Select a contiguous range and confirm workbook, sheet, address, row count, column count, and headers update.
- Select a non-contiguous range and confirm the warning is shown.

## upload_data

- Trigger `upload_data` with natural language and confirm a preview card appears.
- Trigger `upload_data` with `/upload_data ...` and confirm it also routes to the skill.
- Cancel the preview and confirm the thread logs the cancellation without changing Excel.
- Confirm the preview and verify the external API is called with the selected rows.
- Simulate a 4xx/5xx API failure and confirm the error message is shown in the task pane.
- Configure a `Business Base URL` with a path prefix such as `/v1/` and confirm the request preserves the prefix.

## Excel Command Confirmation

- Run a read command and confirm it executes immediately.
- Run a write command and confirm it requires preview + confirmation.
- Leave a confirmation card open and verify the composer stays disabled until confirm or cancel.

## Ribbon Sync

- Bind a blank worksheet through the Ribbon project dropdown and confirm the layout dialog appears with defaults `HeaderStartRow = 1`, `HeaderRowCount = 2`, `DataStartRow = 3`.
- Confirm the layout dialog and enter custom values, then verify `AI_Setting` writes one `SheetBindings` row with the user-entered layout values.
- Confirming project selection should still not auto-initialize the current sheet; `SheetFieldMappings` remains unchanged until `初始化当前表` is clicked.
- Open `AI_Setting` and confirm it uses one worksheet with two readable sections: `SheetBindings` on top, `SheetFieldMappings` below, each with a title row, a header row, and data rows.
- Confirm `SheetFieldMappings` displays headers in this order: `HeaderType`, `ISDP L1`, `Excel L1`, `ISDP L2`, `Excel L2`, `HeaderId`, `ApiFieldKey`, `IsIdColumn`, `ActivityId`, `PropertyId`.
- Confirm there are two blank separator rows between `SheetBindings` and `SheetFieldMappings`, and that metadata is no longer stored as flattened `tableName + values` rows.
- Switch to a worksheet with existing binding metadata and confirm the Ribbon dropdown automatically rehydrates that project as `ProjectId-DisplayName` instead of showing `先选择项目`.
- Save a workbook with `AI_Setting` as the active sheet, reopen Excel from the desktop shortcut, and confirm the Ribbon dropdown shows `先选择项目` unless `SheetBindings` 里存在 `AI_Setting` 这条显式绑定记录。
- Switch from a bound business sheet to `AI_Setting` and confirm the Ribbon dropdown clears back to `先选择项目` when `AI_Setting` itself has no binding.
- Switch to a worksheet without binding metadata and confirm the Ribbon dropdown shows `先选择项目`.
- Open two workbooks in the same Excel process, bind `Sheet1` in each workbook to different projects, switch back and forth between the two files, and confirm the Ribbon dropdown plus download/upload behavior always follow the active workbook's own `AI_Setting` metadata.
- On a sheet that already has binding metadata, switch to another project and confirm the layout dialog defaults reuse the current sheet's saved layout values.
- Reselect the already bound project (`same systemKey + projectId`) and confirm no layout dialog appears and `SheetBindings` is not rewritten.
- Cancel the layout dialog while switching projects and confirm both `AI_Setting` binding data and Ribbon dropdown project stay unchanged.
- After switching to another project and confirming the dialog, verify old `SheetFieldMappings` are cleared; before clicking `初始化当前表`, running download/upload should report that the current sheet is not initialized.
- Enter invalid values in the layout dialog (for example overlaps between header/data regions) and confirm validation error is shown while keeping the dialog open.
- Start Excel while unauthenticated against a protected project API and confirm the project dropdown shows `请先登录`.
- Configure the project API to return an empty array and confirm the project dropdown shows `无可用项目`.
- Click `初始化当前表` on a sheet that already contains business cells and confirm only `AI_Setting` changes; the business area should remain untouched.
- Click `部分下载` and `部分上传` and confirm each action uses a native Office/WinForms confirmation dialog instead of the task pane.
- Confirm the `下载` and `上传` controls are rendered in separate Ribbon groups, that the download group only shows `部分下载`, the upload group only shows `部分上传`, and that there is no `全量下载`, `全量上传`, or `增量上传` button.
- Edit `AI_Setting` so `HeaderStartRow = 3`, `HeaderRowCount = 2`, and `DataStartRow = 6`, then run `全量下载` and confirm headers/data are written at the configured rows.
- On a sheet that already has recognizable headers, run `全量下载` and confirm the plugin refreshes data cells without rewriting those existing headers.
- Modify `Excel L1` or `Excel L2` in `SheetFieldMappings`, update the matching Excel header text manually, then run `部分下载` or `部分上传` and confirm the column still resolves by current header text.
- Set one `single` mapping row to use both `Excel L1` and `Excel L2`, keep `HeaderRowCount = 2`, prepare matching grouped headers on the sheet, then run `部分下载` and confirm the grouped-single column resolves and only the selected child cells are refreshed.
- Using the same grouped-single metadata and visible grouped headers, edit a grouped-single cell and run `部分上传`, then confirm the upload resolves that `single` field correctly and does not require converting it to a non-`single` field type.
- Keep the grouped-single headers already present on the worksheet, run `全量下载`, and confirm the plugin reuses that existing grouped layout instead of flattening or rewriting the recognized headers.
- Clear the worksheet header area, keep the grouped-single metadata in `AI_Setting`, then run `全量下载` and confirm regenerated headers fall back to flat child-only single headers without any grouped parent header row for that `single` field.
- Verify the task pane button and login button still work after the Ribbon Sync controls are added.
